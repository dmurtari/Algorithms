`graph.py`
----------

Contains two classes (`Graph` and `Node`) that together represent a directed,
weighted graph (no node weights). Implemented algorithms include Depth-First
Search, Breadth-First Search, and finding Strongly-Connected Components. Finding
the diameter of the graph also works, but takes a long time.
